CISC/CMPE 457 Assignment 3

Due Friday, December 11 at noon

You can do this assignment in groups of two, if you wish.

0. Run the Python code in this archive.  Press '?' to see the options.
   Note that you can move the image around by dragging the mouse, and
   can zoom by dragging up/down with the right button down.

   Once your code is working, you press 'c' to compute the encoding,
   then decoding, and can then alternately press 'j' and 'o' to
   compare the the JPEG after encoding/decoding ('j') and the original
   image ('o').  Pressing 'd' shows the DCT basis functions.

1. Add code to forwardJPEG() to complete the JPEG encoding as
   specified by the comments in that function.

2. Add code to inverseJPEG() to complete the JPEG decoding as
   specified by the comments in that function.  This is essentially
   the opposite of the code in forwardJPEG().

The changes to forwardJPEG() and inverseJPEG() can be done in 11 lines
of code each if you use NumPy array multiplication and .sum() to
compute the sum-of-products of two arrays, like (a*b).sum().

Debugging output is enabled if you press 'x', then run the JPEG
routine (by pressing 'c').  This output will appear in the file
'debug.txt'.  You can compare your output to the sample output in the
'images' directory.  Look at those files to get an idea of the
expected output.  NOTE: Your debugging output might be slightly
different than the outputs in the 'images' directory.  That is, the
individual numbers might differ by at most 1.

Submit a single Python file to OnQ.  At the top of that file, include
the name(s) and student number(s) of the person(s) who worked on this
submission.
